City Hospital is a well-respected institution in its community. However, the leadership team recognised a growing need to leverage data for better decsion-making.  
Traditionally, financial and operational decisions were made based on intuition and historical trends, which left room for inefficiences and missed oppurtunities.

## 🧭 PROBLEM STATEMENT   
City Hospital is a **well-respected institution in the community** that lacks centralized view of their financial perfomance.  
This made it difficult to identify trends, optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven decisions.  
This project applies **Power Query** and **Power BI visualisation** to reveal:  

## Dashboard 1##
- What is the trend of revenue generation over the given time period 💰  
- Which Specialties yielded thehighest and lowest revenue 💸  
- How much revenue does each procedure category make in hospital  👑  
- What is the total revenue, expenses and profit margin and how many transaction was this achieved 📉

  ## Dashboard 2##
  - Who are the top revenue generating doctor in the hospital
  - Who are the top 5 Patients that impacted on Revenue generation
  - How many doctors are in each specialty and how many patients patronize each of these specialities
  - What is the trend of patients visits to the hospital over time
  - By gender description ive the total No.Doctors and patients in the hospital.
    
By merging data cleaning,Power query, Data modelling and dashboard storytelling, this project transforms raw data into a roadmap for smarter growth and retention.

## 🎯 Steps to take 
1. Data cleaning and integration : This process involves identifying and correcting inconsistencies, missing/null values, and duplicates within the data set. 
2. Data Modelling: This will establish a logical structure for the hospital's data. The model defined the relationships between different data points, allowing for efficient querying and analysis.   
3. DAX Calculations and Dashboard Building: DAX calculations were created to Analyze key performance indicator (KPIs). The dashboard will provide real insights into the hospital's perfomance. 
4. Insights and Recommendations : After analyzing the data, you will identify several key insights that will help you generate data-driven recommendations.
